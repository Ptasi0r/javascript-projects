# JavaScript Projects

> This repository contains 20 small JavaScript projects from [Brad Traversy course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/web-projects-with-vanilla-javascript/)

## Setup

Link to live demo: [Live Demo](https://ptasi0r.github.io/javascript-projects/)

I highly recommend using live demos of projects. If you want to see those projects locally, I recommend using some live server extension, to prevent errors with fetching data form local files.

## Sources

Those projects are based on course from [Brad Traversy](https://www.udemy.com/course/web-projects-with-vanilla-javascript/).

**List of all change done by myself is avaible in [this file](CHANGES.md)**
